1) Can you help me make a Benzene molecule SVG in python? [07.01.2025 - 3 attempts.]
2)  How about a heptagone SVG? [1st attempt via thinking]
3) How about a 9-gon, 11-gon? [1st attempt via thinking]
4) Imagine a rubber band. Imagine this rubber band is being initially in a form of an ellipse, that is being stretched (along X axis) until it is almost fully stretched. (a >> b in ellipse context).
So, our ellipse is in XY plane initially, it is now wide and has little "height", but there's also Z axis.
so, when we stretched ellipse (like, with our hands), we start twisting it's right end around X axis, while holding left edge still. Like, we first stretch a rubber band, then hold one end with fingers, and start twisting it with right hand fingers along left-right direction, so that we make a double-stranded spiral from this rubber band. Did you get it? Now, can you help me write python code, that displays animation of the described transform?

5)Regarding my request above about twisting ellipse into a double-stranded spiral - can you rewrite it into pyopengl or smth like that?
[thinking failed with 4-5 attempts]
